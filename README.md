# Gaming World

Gaming World is a template for website where you can find the latest news, updates, future events and releases about games.

In this website, I wanted to demonstrate techniques like modern sliders, swap effects for mobile devices, timers and counters via using only javascript.

Now it's not a multi-page website. I would rather build it using React.js to guarantee a fast content downloading and less requests on the server.

The website is fully responsive.
